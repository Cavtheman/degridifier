This project aims to create one or more machine learning models that can effectively eliminate overlaid grids on various images. This project was inspired by a problem in the ``Dungeons \& Dragons'' (D\&D) tabletop roleplaying game, traditionally played in small groups in person, which in the time of this pandemic has seen a need for online tools such as \href{www.roll20.net}{Roll20} and \href{www.foundryvtt.com}{Foundry VTT}, with the latter having 8+ million users as of March 2021. For these tools players will often use so-called ``battlemaps'' which are essentially (often hand drawn) images of terrain seen from a bird's eye view. These images often have grids overlaid on them, which due to their hand drawn nature often vary significantly in size, style and color. While these grids are needed in the game, the aforementioned tools add these grids on top themselves which makes maps with grids on them undesirable at times. Therefore, this project will aim to implement models in PyTorch to get rid of these grids

The methods explored here will likely also be applicable in situations where one would want to remove some types of artifacts and potentially watermarks (though that is not recommended or intended) from other images, such as satellite images, like those seen in \cite{intro}
