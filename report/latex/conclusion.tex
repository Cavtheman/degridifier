In this project, I aimed to construct a model which could remove grid lines from arbitrary ``battlemaps'' found on the internet. This turned out to be a more difficult problem than expected, likely due in part to the various differing styles used to make these grids. A few of the models trained on artificial data have done quite well on that data, though they do not generalise to the different styles that can be seen in the real data. Trying to get the cycleGAN to output something useful was not successful however, with various different explanations as to why this might be.

In the making of this project I have gained a lot of experience working with cycleGANs and the intricacies of cyclical learning. Many of the iterations before the ones shown here had significant problems with deviating from reasonable predictions, and this taught me much both about cycleGANs and GANs in general.
